Competency
In this project, you will demonstrate your mastery of the following competency:

Write professional, well-documented, and readable code
Scenario:
As a recent graduate of SNHU, you’ve taken the time to consider the type of work you really want to do and therefore have focused your job search on junior developer positions. In searching the major job boards, you discover Chada Tech.

Chada Tech is a software engineering company that specializes in custom software design and development for both domestic and international clients. You read more about the company and decide this place would be a great fit for you. You are also happy to find that there is an opening for a junior developer and apply for the position immediately. The skills that you have acquired at SNHU have prepared you for this role. Consequently, you are selected for an interview!

As part of the Chada Tech interview process, you are asked to complete a coding skills test to “audition” for the role. This is a typical interviewing strategy that you may encounter in the field. Companies utilize this technique to ensure candidates can in fact do what they claim they can do. Therefore, this exercise will be based on a problem similar to what you will face in the junior developer role, and you will need to come up with a solution. This is your chance to really show them what you can do!

The Chada Tech interviewing team has provided you with the following problem statement and a document containing a set of functional requirements:

Chada Tech has domestic and international clients. To meet international standard ISO 8601, Chada Tech wants their clients to be able to view a 12- and a 24-hour clock on their website rather than just the standard 12-hour clock.
To stand out as a top candidate, you will need to apply program logic by creating two clocks that display simultaneously and allow for user input using secure and efficient C++ code.

Directions:
Develop an object-oriented programming (OOP) application to create two clocks that display simultaneously and allow for user input using secure and efficient C++ code.

Review the Chada Tech Clocks Functional Requirements, located in the Supporting Materials section.
Review the following flowchart, as it is a graphical representation of the logic you will use in relation to your application’s sequence of functions. A text version of this flowchart is available: Project One Flowchart Text Version.
Clocks Flowchart

Your code should be properly modularized and written in functions so that your main() has the least amount of code.
Before you begin coding, remember that you must demonstrate industry standard best practices in all your code to ensure clarity, consistency, and efficiency. This includes:
Inserting in-line comments to denote your changes and to briefly describe the functionality of the code
Using appropriate variable, parameter, and other naming conventions throughout your code
When your solution is finished, zip your project including all components (CPP, H, and any other files used).
Upload your zipped project file to the project submission area.
